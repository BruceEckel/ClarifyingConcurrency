# Clarifying Concurrency

Note that I have abandonded this project.
To understand why, read `0. Why I Quit.md`.

Research writings as part of developing a book on the foundations of concurrency, for experienced programmers
who either know nothing about concurrency or are confused by it.

This book uses Python for both its simplicity and mass appeal, but the concepts are foundational concurrency in general.
My goal is for people to be able to read articles and books about concurrency (even those that claim to be for beginners,
but almost never are) without getting overwhelmed by all the differing concepts and terminology.
