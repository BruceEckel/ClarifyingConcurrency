> A presentation proposal for Pycon 2024

Structured concurrency is a foundational improvement, akin to the evolution from goto-based spaghetti code to programming with functions. For this reason, Python and some other programming languages have adopted support for structured concurrency. In this presentation we learn why structured concurrency emerged, what it is, how it improves your concurrent programs, and the thorough support provided by the Python `asyncio` library, including scoped tasks, cancellation, and error handling.

- The legacy of threads: no lifetime, cancellation, error capture (8 min)
- How structured programming inspired structured concurrency (7 min)
- Creating scopes for coroutines (5 min)
- Structured concurrency: Every task has a parent, cancellation flows downward, and errors flow upward.  (15 min)
- Completion guarantees no dangling tasks. (5 min)
- Structured concurrency code is *composable*. (5 min)
