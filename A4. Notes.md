- The articles moved over from Substack are initially organized in publication order, but I will start rearranging them into a more pedagogical order to reflect the organization of the book. New articles will be inserted in appropriate places.
- The goal is to first publish the book through Leanpub, but eventually go through a regular publisher. At some point the project will move over to Leanpub, at which point many of the articles here may disappear. This way, I am not trying to maintain them in two places.
- I am using tooling (which you can find [here](https://github.com/BruceEckel/markdown_tools)) to check and update the example code listings. I will also create [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) tests for the examples when possible, and will be using type annotations together with type checkers such as [Mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) to further ensure correctness.
- I use [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) to create and build examples, and it will be easiest if you install Rye as well to run and modify the examples.
