Imagine that there's a circle surrounding you, represent a boundary (don't worry about the size; you have permission to resize your imaginary boundary as needed). Inside this boundary are things that you have control over in your life; things that are completely reliable and predictable, as much as that is possible. For example, you know how your toaster works, and its idiosyncrasies. Your stove, dishwasher, washing machine, shower---all these are under your control, and you can expect consistent and predictable results when you use them.

You could stay in your house just using these devices, getting groceries delivered and never leaving. You would always know how things work and nothing would change. This gets boring. We get stimulus and grow by connecting with the outside world, where things are unpredictable. The world outside the circle.
