From [TREE-STRUCTURED CONCURRENCY](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/tree-structured-concurrency/)
- Under structured concurrency every task has a parent, cancellation flows downward, and errors flow upward. Completion guarantees no dangling tasks. 
- "A function will return when it's done, will cancel all work when you ask it to, and you'll always receive an error if there is something which needs handling. And as a result code under this model isÂ **composable**."
