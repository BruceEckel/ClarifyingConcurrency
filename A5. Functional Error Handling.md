- Exceptions as effects (what's the problem?)
- Replacing Exceptions with Return Values
- Value | None and the walrus operator
- The "Result" library
- and_then() for automatic unpacking and termination

In early days, people wrote small applications in assembly language, using gotos to get around. This didn't scale, so we traded gotos for structured functions with single entry & exit points—and then we added a new kind of goto with the exception, which not only blows up your function but can end up anywhere. This makes functions difficult to compose. We’ll look at several strategies supported by Python that bring exceptions under control and make functions composable again, including a library based on Rust’s design for this problem.
